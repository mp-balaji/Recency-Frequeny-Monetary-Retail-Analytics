# RFM Analysis

## Personalized Marketing Plans for Automobile Component Manufacturer

This project revolves around leveraging three years' worth of transactional data collected by a manufacturer of automobile components. The primary objective is to harness this valuable historical data to generate personalized marketing plans tailored to different client categories.

### Problem Statement

The manufacturer faces the challenge of optimizing its marketing strategies and resources to cater to various client segments effectively. To address this, I have implemented RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis, a powerful technique in customer segmentation and targeting.

### RFM Analysis

RFM analysis involves assessing the following aspects for each customer:

- **Recency:** How recently did the customer make a purchase?
- **Frequency:** How often does the customer make purchases?
- **Monetary:** How much does the customer spend?

By evaluating these parameters, we can categorize customers into different segments based on their buying behavior. This information is invaluable for crafting personalized marketing strategies for each group, such as tailored promotions, recommendations, or communication channels.
